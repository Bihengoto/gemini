## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"dart: command not found"** - Dart SDK not installed or not in PATH
2. **File not found** - Check file path and spelling
3. **Syntax errors** - Check for missing semicolons, brackets, or quotes

### Solutions:
- Verify Dart installation: `dart --version`
- Check file paths are correct
- Use VS Code's built-in error highlighting
- Read error messages carefully - they usually point to the problem
