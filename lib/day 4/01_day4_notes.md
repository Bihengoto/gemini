# Day 4: Loops & Collections (Lists)

## Learning Objectives
- Master different types of loops in Dart
- Understand control flow with break and continue
- Work with Lists (Dart's equivalent of arrays)
- Practice combining loops with collections

## Topics Covered

### 1. Loop Types
- **for loop**: Best for known iterations
- **while loop**: Best for condition-based iterations
- **do-while loop**: Executes at least once

### 2. Loop Control
- **break**: Exits the loop completely
- **continue**: Skips current iteration, continues with next

### 3. Lists (Collections)
- Dynamic arrays in Dart
- Basic operations: add, remove, access
- Iteration through lists

### 4. Best Practices
- Choose appropriate loop type for the task
- Use meaningful variable names
- Avoid infinite loops
- Consider using built-in list methods when appropriate

## Practice Exercise
Create a list of names and print each name using different loop types.
