// Day 16: Packages & Libraries - Overview
// =====================================

/*
WHAT ARE PACKAGES IN DART/FLUTTER?

Packages are reusable libraries of code that extend the functionality 
of your Dart/Flutter applications. They allow you to:

1. Add new features without writing everything from scratch
2. Use community-tested and maintained code
3. Save development time
4. Follow best practices established by the community

TYPES OF PACKAGES:
- Dart packages: Pure Dart code that works on all platforms
- Flutter packages: Include Flutter-specific functionality
- Plugin packages: Provide access to platform-specific APIs

WHERE TO FIND PACKAGES:
- pub.dev: The official package repository for Dart and Flutter
- GitHub: Many packages are hosted here
- Local packages: You can create your own packages
