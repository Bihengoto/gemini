### 5. Compute Function (`05_compute_function.dart`)
- Flutter's simplified isolate API
- Manual implementation of compute-like functionality
- Error handling in isolates
- Multiple parallel computations

### 6. Practical Examples (`06_practical_examples.dart`)
- Real-world use cases:
  - Large JSON parsing
  - Image processing simulation
  - Data analysis and statistics
  - Encryption/decryption operations

### 7. Practice Exercise (`07_practice_exercise.dart`)
- Complete implementation of prime number calculator
- Progress reporting from isolates
- Multiple isolates working together
- Performance comparison with and without isolates

## Key Concepts

### Isolates vs Async/Await
```dart
// Async/Await - Single-threaded concurrency
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  return await http.get('api/data'); // Non-blocking I/O
}

// Isolates - Multi-threaded concurrency  
Future<int> heavyCalculation() async {
  return await compute(calculatePrimes, 1000000); // CPU-intensive
}
```

### When to Use Isolates
✅ **Use Isolates for:**
- CPU-intensive calculations
- Large data processing
- Image/video processing
- Cryptographic operations
- Mathematical computations

❌ **Don't use Isolates for:**
- Simple async operations
- File I/O (already non-blocking)
- Network requests (already non-blocking)
- Database queries (already non-blocking)

### Basic Isolate Pattern
```dart
// 1. Create ReceivePort
final receivePort = ReceivePort();

// 2. Spawn isolate
await Isolate.spawn(isolateFunction, receivePort.sendPort);

// 3. Get result
final result = await receivePort.first;

// 4. Clean up
receivePort.close();
```

### Communication Pattern
```dart
// Main Isolate
final receivePort = ReceivePort();
await Isolate.spawn(workerIsolate, receivePort.sendPort);
final result = await receivePort.first;

// Worker Isolate
static void workerIsolate(SendPort sendPort) {
  // Do work
  final result = performCalculation();
  
  // Send result back
  sendPort.send(result);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use compute() for simple cases** - Flutter's compute function simplifies isolate usage
2. **Handle errors properly** - Wrap isolate operations in try-catch blocks
3. **Clean up resources** - Always close ReceivePort and kill isolates when done
4. **Minimize data transfer** - Only send necessary data between isolates
5. **Consider overhead** - Isolates have creation overhead, use for substantial work
6. **Progress reporting** - For long-running tasks, send progress updates
7. **Multiple isolates** - Use multiple isolates for parallel processing of independent tasks

## Performance Tips

- Isolate creation has overhead (~1-2ms)
- Message passing involves serialization/deserialization
- Use isolates for tasks taking >16ms (one frame at 60fps)
- Consider using isolate pools for frequent operations
- Profile your app to measure actual performance impact

## Common Patterns

### Fire-and-forget
```dart
Isolate.spawn(backgroundTask, data);
```

### Request-response
```dart
final result = await compute(calculation, input);
```

### Long-running worker
```dart
final controller = IsolateController();
await controller.start();
await controller.sendTask(task);
await controller.shutdown();
```

### Multiple workers
```dart
final futures = List.generate(4, (i) => 
  compute(processChunk, chunks[i])
);
final results = await Future.wait(futures);
```
