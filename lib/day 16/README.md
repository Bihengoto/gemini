## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Dart syntax
- Flutter development environment set up
- Familiarity with async/await concepts

### Setup Instructions

1. **Add packages to pubspec.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     http: ^1.1.0
     shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
     intl: ^0.19.0
   ```

2. **Install packages:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the examples:**
   ```bash
   dart run lib/day\ 16/01_packages_overview.dart
   dart run lib/day\ 16/04_http_package_example.dart
   dart run lib/day\ 16/07_practical_exercise.dart
   ```

## 📖 Key Concepts

### Package Types
- **Dart packages**: Pure Dart code, platform-independent
- **Flutter packages**: Include Flutter-specific widgets and functionality
- **Plugin packages**: Provide access to platform-specific APIs

### Version Constraints
- `^1.0.0`: Compatible with 1.x.x (recommended)
- `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`: Explicit range
- `1.0.0`: Exact version (not recommended)

### Essential Commands
- `flutter pub get`: Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade`: Update packages
- `flutter pub add <package>`: Add new package
- `flutter pub deps`: Show dependency tree

## 🛠 Practical Exercise

The main exercise builds a Quote of the Day app that demonstrates:
- API requests using the HTTP package
- Local data storage with shared_preferences
- Date formatting with the intl package
- Error handling and user feedback

## 📚 Popular Packages to Explore

### Networking
- `http`: Simple HTTP requests
- `dio`: Advanced HTTP client with interceptors

### State Management
- `provider`: Simple state management
- `bloc`: Business Logic Component pattern
- `riverpod`: Advanced provider-based solution

### UI Components
- `flutter_staggered_grid_view`: Advanced grid layouts
- `carousel_slider`: Image/content carousels

### Utilities
- `shared_preferences`: Simple key-value storage
- `path_provider`: File system access
- `url_launcher`: Launch URLs and apps

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you should be able to:
- ✅ Find and evaluate packages on pub.dev
- ✅ Add packages to your Flutter project
- ✅ Understand and modify pubspec.yaml
- ✅ Use the HTTP package for API requests
- ✅ Manage package versions and dependencies
- ✅ Follow best practices for package management

## 🔗 Useful Resources

- [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) - Official Dart package repository
- [Flutter Packages](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins) - Official documentation
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) - Version numbering guide

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple, well-documented packages
2. **Read Documentation**: Always check the package's README and examples
3. **Check Maintenance**: Choose actively maintained packages
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test package integration in your development environment
5. **Version Carefully**: Use appropriate version constraints

## 🎉 Next Steps
